Open your terminal and type 
nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
under [ifupdown] edit managed = false to managed = true 
then under [keyfile] comment a '#' before unmanaged devices 
thats it!
a shell code could've been made but the fix is faster and helps the user to keep track if the error occurs in the future.
